## My process

### Built with

- Love ðŸ’–
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Custom Properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned the importance of having a proper and organized workflow when coding; from how to structure my HTML code, how and where to add classes, to how to add in my CSS systematically using a top-down approach. I've always approached building a website with a desktop-first workflow, but my first attempt at a mobile-first approach allowed me to see how much easier, and better, this way was.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning how to better utilise more HTML tags like `article`, `section`, `picture` (as opposed to just using a `div`), as well as HTML's `data-*` attribute. With CSS, I have always defaulted to using `flex`, but using `grid` is something I want to explore more in depth. This project introduced me to working with `SVGs` for the first time so I would love to continue working with them. Overall, this is only just the beginning, and I have a lot more to learn ðŸ¤™

### Useful resources

[MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) my most beloved, I would be so lost without her ðŸ’– And some other resources I used in this project:
